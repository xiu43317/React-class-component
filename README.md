# React-class-component

This is my first React work which was adapted from an IT forum in Taiwan. As a react beginner, I thought I should copy someone's example and turn it into my style. I have studied a lot of documents from the react official website and follow it's demonstrations. But I thought I still needed something to prove how much I knew about the react concepts. As a result, I decided to make a blog system with CRUD functions. This example just had Create and Delete functions at first, so I decided to add an Update function into this app. In addaition, I also changed some structures from the backend which was made by node.js. This work I didn't put it on my website because latter I finished another one which was edited with function component and I also put it on my website.
